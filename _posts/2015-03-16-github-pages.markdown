What if I told you, you could have a website up and running within the hour that was free. Github allows you to create one website using it's website. It is referred to as github pages. 

What I want you to do is create a one page html file with some very basic content.

* Log into github 
    * create a repository with the name \<username\>.github.io
       * For example: spaceotterinspace.github.io
* Log into cloud 9 with your github username
   * Choose the repository with the name you just created and clone to edit.
   * Select html5
* create a file called index.html
* put some html in here
* put it back on github
    * type in the tab called bash (the command line) 
    * you can use these steps every time you want to push changes to github

> git add -A <br />
> git commit -m \"Initial commit\" <br />
> git push <br />


* In about 30 minutes you will have a website at \<username\>.github.io
    * example: type spaceotterinspace.github.io in the url bar
* profit!!
