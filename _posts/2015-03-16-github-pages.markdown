What if I told you, you could have a website up and running within the hour that was free. Github allows you to create one website using it's website. It is referred to as github pages. 

What I want you to do is create a one page html file with some very basic content.

* Log into github 
    * create a repository with the name \<username\>.github.io
    * Copy the git url (this is a string that looks something like git@github.com:owner)
* Log into cloud 9 with your github username
   * Create a new project by cloning from an existing repository. Paste the url that you copied from github.
   * Select html5
* create a file called index.html
* put some html in here
* put it bakc on github
    * on the tab called bash (the command line)
    * git add .
    * git commit -m "Initial commit"
    * git push
* profit!!
