        Barcamp is made possible not only by our generous sponsors and organizers, but also by you - Barcamp's attendees. The speaker line-up is generated by you and the other attendees who have a topic, story, knowledge, or experience to share with the rest of the community.

        While it's a tech-focused event, anything goes. Heck, "How to make the perfect sandwich" is a deliciously acceptable talk, especially if you've got a hands-on demo of the latest sandwich technology.
