Welcome to learning how to build websites. This blog is meant to put you on a path so that you can build a website yourself. There are so many ways to build websites and technologies to use that it can be overwhelming picking a place to get started. This blog is meant to help you navigate technology choices and beginning projects that it is possible for you to tackle yourself. I've put together a guide to a path for building websites. I have suggestions for technologies but most of the ones I have chosen have alternatives that are equally accpetable so feel free to use something else if you have a strong preference. I will not be able to assist in troubleshooting as much if you choose a technology I am not familiar with.
